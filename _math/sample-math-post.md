# Introduction to Category Theory

This is where you can write your mathematical content. You can include:

- LaTeX equations using MathJax
- Code blocks
- Images
- Links to PDFs

## Example LaTeX equation:

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

## Including PDFs

You can include PDFs by linking to them in your assets folder:

## Long-form content

This is where you can write detailed explanations, proofs, and other mathematical content. The styling will automatically handle proper formatting of headers, lists, and other elements while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic.
